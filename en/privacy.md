# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to [roelc.me](https://roelc.me). Your privacy is important to me. This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your information when you visit my website. I am committed to safeguarding your personal data and ensuring your privacy is protected.

## Information I Collect

### Personal Information
I do not collect any personal information from my users unless you voluntarily provide it to me. This may include your name, email address, phone number, or other information you choose to provide when you contact me or subscribe to my services.

### Non-Personal Information
When you visit my website, I may collect non-personal information about your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and the date and time of your visit. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather demographic information.

### Google Analytics
I use Google Analytics to collect and analyze information about the use of my website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to my site. This information helps me understand how visitors engage with my website and improve its functionality. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit my site, rather than your name or other identifying information. I do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
